<p>Agree (Novel topic, task, or application)</p>
<p><strong>Q14 (Reusable insights: The paper provides reusable insights (i.e. the capacity to gain an accurate and deep understanding). Such insights may go beyond the scope of the paper, domain or application, in order to build up consistent knowledge across the MIR community.)</strong></p>
<p>Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Q15 (Please explain your assessment of reusable insights in the paper.)</strong></p>
<p>I think that the authors did a first pass at coming up with a fingering difficulty model for saxophone but I am not clear what reusable insights could be applied to other woodwinds, for example, since I think that the paper does not give enough detail about the data collection or the experimental validation to make it clear which of their approaches to measuring difficulty shows the most promise.</p>
<p><strong>Q16 ( Write ONE line (in your own words) with the main take-home message from the paper.)</strong></p>
<p>They propose a method for estimating the difficulty of pieces for
for the tenor saxophone, using transition difficulty between pairs of notes to estimate difficulty. This is based on trill data.</p>
<p><strong>Q17 (This paper is of award-winning quality.)</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>Q19 (Potential to generate discourse: The paper will generate discourse at the ISMIR conference or have a large influence/impact on the future of the ISMIR community.)</strong></p>
<p>Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Q20 (Overall evaluation (to be completed before the discussion phase): Please first evaluate before the discussion phase. Keep in mind that minor flaws can be corrected, and should not be a reason to reject a paper. Please familiarize yourself with the reviewer guidelines at https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines.)</strong></p>
<p>Weak accept</p>
<p><strong>Q21 (Main review and comments for the authors (to be completed before the discussion phase). Please summarize strengths and weaknesses of the paper. It is essential that you justify the reason for the overall evaluation score in detail. Keep in mind that belittling or sarcastic comments are not appropriate.)</strong></p>
<p>As a saxophone player, I am very sympathetic to the goals of the paper. I like that the authors explored several methods of determining difficulty of passages. I think that the description of their data collection was, however, underspecified and the experimental results did not convincingly establish which of their methods (based on trill data, based on expert input, based on finger features) was the most informative. </p>
<p>Weakness: The data collection section did not specify trills were used in this study. Only a single 1/2 step trill from B to B flat is shown. They specify use of the bis key. This key would likely not be used to play a Bb (A#) in a B major scale or a B major 7 chord, since it would leave the 2nd finger in the wrong place to cover the appropriate key when playing the next note. A different fingering (using a side key) is much more likely. Basing the transition difficulty on limited trill data may be problematic because the saxophone has multiple trill fingerings that are specifically for trills but are not appropriate for use in scalar passages or arpeggios. If trill speed is used as a proxy for transition difficulty, then trill fingerings may make transitions seem easier than they typically are in most passages.</p>
<p>The authors state "Each combination of covered keys has a sufficiently unique map to which fingers are active, so the “Finger” features can be derived automatically from the “Raw” features." Is this true? Using their example trill fingering of the bis B flat, one can compare that to the fingering for A and the set of fingers used is identical. </p>
<p>The expert features section is a good attempt to capture issues that arise in saxophone fingerings.</p>
<p>I wonder why the authors weight their model error calculation by frequency of intervals in the Weimar Jazz Database (WJD). Wouldn't it be more likely that rare intervals are, in fact, harder? One might instead use the frequency of interval as a kind of alternative ground truth that may be useful to predict difficulty: more rare intervals may be harder to play.</p>
<p>In section 6 the results are somewhat difficult to interpret. What are the units? When they say the linear model has MSE of 0.97 is this measured in transitions per second? When they say something has MAPE of .37, does that mean 37% or does it mean 0.37%? Also, how is precision measured? Is there an en epsilon where, if the model's estimate is less than epsilon different from truth it counts as being correct? </p>
<p>In section 8 the authors state " First, because some notes have multiple fingerings, the “fastest” (maximal) path through the part in terms of fingerings is found with Viterbi decoding over the estimated trill speeds." This sounds interesting but I'm unclear on what they mean. There are, for example 5 ways to finger the B flat in the example from Figure 1. How do they estimate trill speeds for all 5 when they only measured 1 fingering? Without that information, how can they build a Markov transition graph for all 5 fingerings so the fastest one can be selected with Viterbi?</p>
<p>The authors mention that their method requires access to an expert to give them information and to realize some of the trills for their data collection. Is it possible that they should have collected data from people that are not experts, as it may be that novices may have difficulty in some transitions that experts have completely mastered? </p>
<p>It would seem natural to take their estimation of difficulty, apply it to musical passages (as shown in figure 8) and then ask saxophone players to independently rate the difficulty of the passages. One could ask them to circle the hard parts and then the model could be evaluated on precision/recall on its ability to identify the passages the humans called difficult. The authors have done all the work needed to develop the model that could be evaluated this way. Now they just need to actually do it. That would be very interesting validation.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>This paper provides a robust pedagogy-founded approach for difficulty estimation in saxophone music, a very under-investigated repertoire in computer-supported music education research in general, but also in difficulty estimation in particular. This paper can serve as a foundation for future research on wind-family instruments.</p>
<p>MAJOR COMMENT
It is not clear to me whether transition difficulties are just measured as a function of trill speeds (this seems to be implied in the lines 280-281). I think this might be a too narrow approach and because of this a clarification would be worthy here in order to highlight the interplay between other variables involved as well as their relationship to speed. 
In addition, and related to the previous, I do not fully understand how player proficiency is controlled for. Although proficiency is directly related to the ability to play repertoire of a given difficulty level, individual skills concerning specific challenges play also a role in mastering an instrument completely. In this regard, it is not clear (even if fatigue is briefly mentioned in line 308) how individual strengths and weakness from the different players are considered in determining transitions' difficulty levels. Without controlling for proficiency, results might reflect player skill rather than the intrinsic transition challenge. 
Finally, a hypothesis about why player 5 is amongst the faster and slower players would also be important in order to understand individual differences amongst the included musicians. Was player 5 a beginner or an advanced player? Was under determined conditions when performing slow? Player 5 is referred to twice in the paper, but an interpretation of the reasons behind their performance is missing.</p>
<p>MINOR COMMENTS
Figure 8 seems to imply that a tool to visually inspect difficulty transitions is available and could be used to explore other content beyond the paper. No website however can be found referred to in the article, so if such a Tool exist, this should be clearly pointed out. I interpret, however, Fig 8 is merely a plot designed to illustrate the described concept. I do not see anything wrong with this, but it should be clearly indicated as such, to avoid misleading interpretations.</p>
<p>Although several limitations concerning other aspects such as voicing, articulation, etc. are pointed out, the accumulative difficulty derived by cognitive overload of playing a long passage, specially containing difficult transitions, seems not to be considered. Adding a note about this could be important.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>I really enjoyed reading your work, thanks. Here below I are some comments for improving the quality of the paper:
-) Line 2 Use the word "both" only with two items. You have listed three.
-) Line 13 "trill speeds" - give more information about the trills, assuming that this is the first time the reader is seeing the information. For example, mention that the trills are between each possible pair of notes.
-) Figure 5 - For the same finger transition, why 10 and not just 1?
-) Figure 8: it is difficult to understand what you mean by "redder", because some of the notes appear more orange than red. Maybe use a scale of blue (easier) to red (more difficult) to make it clear. 
-) Line 421: space needed between sentences
-) Lines 525-529: Incomplete reference, should have volume and page numbers.
-) Lines 584-605: Please check the title.
Generally, please check the references to make sure they are in uniform format. For example, two papers from ISMIR are formatted differently.
The abstract could be clearer. Please do not assume the reader is already familiar with the work described in the paper.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>In this paper the authors estimate the difficulty of saxophone parts based on a model created using player trill speed between pairs of notes as training data, then estimating total cost of transitions of the part. The models tested are simple regression and a multi-layer perceptron. Expert features with an MLP seemed to be the most accurate solution for this problem.</p>
<p>The strengths include that it is based on genuine player abilities, and even has data from players of different skill levels.
Interesting that there is much variation in relative ease of trilling between players. This would not have been known without this experiment.</p>
<p>Minor matters:
Line 257 has "embrochure" instead of "embouchure".
Line 437: "a a "</p>
