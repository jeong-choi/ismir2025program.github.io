    "abstract": "The music industry attracts a large number of investors due to its high turnover. Releasing hit songs can garner profits, whereas flop songs lead to losses. Thus, predicting the popularity of a song before its release can help in promotion plans. Can we really predict hit Songs? This is the main motivation of the work. Extensive work is being done for western songs, but Indian music is relatively less explored. Hence, our work aims to predict hit songs of Indian origin using acoustic features. To analyze tracks, a data set is created from data provided by the Spotify Web API. The features are extracted using Spotify, available libraries such as Librosa and aubio, which are passed to machine learning algorithms for prediction. Along with available features, melodic features based on patterns are proposed and extracted. A comparative analysis is done for four acoustic feature sets containing timbral, pitch, rhythm and melodic features proposed. Further experimentation is performed with the combined features sets resulting in the improved performance. The results are encouraging and hit song prediction can be a reality in the near future.",

    "abstract": "FixMatch, a semi-supervised learning method proposed for image classification, includes unlabeled data instances into the training procedure by predicting labels for differently augmented versions of the unlabeled data. In our previous work, we adapted FixMatch to audio classification by applying image augmentations to spectral representations of the audio signal. While this approach matched the performance of the supervised baseline with only a fraction of the training data, the performance of audio-specific augmentation techniques, and their effect on the FixMatch approach was not evaluated. In this work, we replace all image-based augmentation techniques with audio-specific ones and keep the feature extraction unchanged. The audio-specific approach improved upon the supervised baseline which confirms the effectiveness of the FixMatch approach for semi-supervised learning even with a completely different set of augmentations. However, the image-based approach outperforms the audio-based approach on the three audio classification tasks evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The extraction of fundamental frequency (F0) information from music recordings is a crucial task in the field of music information retrieval. The sequence of F0-estimates over successive time frames (also called F0-trajectory) often corresponds to a melodic phrase and serves as a representation for downstream tasks such as automatic music transcription and performance analysis. A large number of algorithms and tools for F0-estimation have been proposed in the literature and implemented in various programming languages. However, these heterogeneous implementations are often not easily comparable and may vary considerably in performance and accuracy, which is problematic for reproducible research. In this contribution, we introduce libf0, a Python library of reference implementations that can conveniently be used to apply, compare, and develop F0-estimation algorithms in a reproducible way.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that the analysis of musical performance videos benefits from a multimodal learning due to the close interaction between audio characteristics and visual gestures by the performer. However, every performer displays idiosyncrasies in both modalities. Thus, general tasks like raga classification are affected by the introduction of singer specific information into the data which can adversely affect the results. In this work-in-progress discussion, we attempt to disentangle the singer specific characteristics from both audio and video modalities in unimodal and multimodal settings. In particular, we build on approaches used earlier in emotion recognition and racial bias removal tasks based on a multitask framework where we consider joint optimisation of classification loss and a loss to enable performer disentanglement. We build on our previous work on multimodal raga classification with various fusion strategies in this work to understand the impact of individual characteristics superimposed in both modalities.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, without large human-annotated datasets, music generation constrained to a predefined musical form has not been well studied. In this demo paper, we present a GPT2-based melody generation system for generating well-structured melodies via controllable similarity and length. We design several embeddings and tokens to modelling similarity and length information within the music, and train the GPT-2 model with a large dataset in ABC notation. With preliminary experimental results and examples of self-similarity matrices, we demonstrate the potential of this system for generating melodies with long-term repetitive structures.",

    "abstract": "We contribute an interactive visual frontend to live coding environments, which allows live coders and performers to influence the behavior of their code more quickly and efficiently. Users can trigger actions and change parameters via instruments, buttons, and sliders, instead of only inside the code. For instance, toggling a loop or controlling a fading effect through mouse or touch interaction on a screen is faster than editing code. While this kind of control has already been possible with hardware MIDI devices, we provide a more accessible, easy-to-use, and customizable alternative that only requires a web browser. With examples, we show how users perform live-coded music faster and more easily with our design compared to using pure code.",

    "abstract": "Gamaka (note ornamentation) is an essential element of Carnatic music. Earlier works in computer-generated gamakas focused on developing mathematical models of each gamaka, which fails to capture the intricate changes in pitch and thus does not sound natural. To address this challenge, this work approaches the synthesis of gamaka for kalpitha swaras (composed notes) in Carnatic music using a data-driven system. The model uses masked latent space representation in an auto-encoder architecture with features extracted using convolutional layers. \n It takes as input, the pitch contour extracted from symbolic data to generate a pitch contour with gamaka information embedded in it. The model is successful in synthesizing gamaka with nuances that closely follow the ground truth.",

Almost all virtual instruments today employ the pitch bend joystick/wheel on a keyboard to solely manipulate the fundamental frequency or the pitch of the note being played. While this feature allows a perceptually realistic reproduction of slides in a few instruments, it largely fails to do so with plucked string instruments, especially non-Western traditional instruments. In this abstract, I chose to study the meend technique in Sitar performance in order to understand in finer detail the factors (including, but not limited to, the fundamental frequency) that characterize the glide between two notes.",

The scientific parameters were analysed and compared with the standard instrument. The tonal quality calibration of the instrument was digitally performed in a studio environment with the help of a computer and an interface. The analysis showed that there was difference in the single tone \u201ctha\u201d and \u201cthi\u201d in terms of the peak frequency. The maximum frequency of \u201ctha\u201d in wooden daya was 770 Hz whereas in fibre daya it was 526 Hz. The peak frequency of \u201cthin\u201d in wooden daya was 236 and that in fibre daya was 278Hz. Frequency analysis of combined tones also showed difference in the peak frequencies. Generally, it could be observed that the peak frequency difference was more in open notes than in closed notes.",

Here we investigated through machine learning whether four music source locations (front, back, left, and right) could be accurately differentiated according to the type of valence in a subject-wise manner using spectral features extracted from electrophysiological (EEG) data. The results show that the four source locations can accurately be classified by different EEG correlates and that the effect is stronger when music characterized by negative emotional valence is played outside the listener's field of view. This proof-of-concept study may pave the way for advanced spatial audio analysis approaches in music information retrieval by taking into account the listener's emotional impact depending on the source direction of incidence.",

These studies, however, face the challenge of varying acoustic features among stimuli, which can con-found with the effect of preference. Also, access to physiological signals is often limited in real-life applications such as smart devices. In this study, we aimed to reduce the effect of acoustic variability by presenting different expressions of the same musical piece while connecting the study to daily use by shortening the stimulus length. We predicted participants\u2019 preference for musical expressions from cardiac and respiratory data measured from 30 subjects in a psychophysiological experiment. We identified a non-linear relationship between physiological signals and musical preference over an ultrashort time interval (~15 s). This result suggests that music recommendation systems can use biological signals to adapt their model rapidly on minimal data retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Music structure analysis (MSA) systems aim to segment a song recording into non-overlapping sections with useful labels. Previous MSA systems typically predict abstract labels in a post-processing step and require the full context of the song. By contrast, we recently proposed a supervised framework, called \"Music Structural Function Analysis\" (MuSFA), that models and predicts meaningful labels like 'verse' and 'chorus' directly from audio, without requiring the full context of a song. However, the performance of this system depends on the amount and quality of training data. In this paper, we propose to repurpose a public dataset, HookTheory Lead Sheet Dataset (HLSD), to improve the performance. HLSD contains over 18K excerpts of music sections originally collected for studying automatic melody harmonization. We treat each excerpt as a partially labeled song and provide a label mapping, so that HLSD can be used together with other public datasets, such as SALAMI, RWC, and Isophonics. In cross-dataset evaluations, we find that including HLSD in training can improve state-of-the-art boundary detection and section labeling scores by ~3% and ~1% respectively.",

The user can set valence and arousal curves which the system uses to generate a soundscape composition matching the desired eventfulness and mood. By streamlining the composition process, AUME aims to relieve some of the cognitive work done by sound designers. AUME's latest iteration draws from a database of nearly half a million audio files, each paired with a list of textual sound descriptors. Along with this expanded capacity, comes a refined ability to interpret a wider lexicon describing sound. Improvements to AUME\u2019s algorithms and architecture for sound retrieval, segmentation, background and foreground classification, automatic mixing and automatic soundscape affect recognition, makes it a powerful system that generates believable soundscapes at interactive rates.",

Therefore, a multimodal\n approach to strumming action transcription is proposed,\n combining audio recordings with the motion of the\n hand. The audio signal is used for strumming event detection\n and the motion signal is used for direction classification.\n To measure the motion of the hand, a 6-axis\n gyroscope and accelerometer is mounted on the back of\n the hand which sends measurements to a computer. For\n evaluation purposes, a recording of five minutes has been\n labelled manually and is published along with this work.\n On this test dataset, the presented multimodal approach\n reaches an F1 score of 85% for the up and 92% for the\n down strumming transcription task.",

    "abstract": "The piano-roll has been the de-facto standard representation for melodic and harmonic content in DAWs for decades, yet direct manipulation of those requires expert knowledge of music theory to begin with, and additionally becomes physically impractical when switching to the smaller, touch-based screens of modern mobile devices, too coarse for the precision required by micro-timings and the unforgiving discrete placement of pitches. Imbuing these interfaces with machine learning and offloading their precise and error-prone aspects to style-adaptive AI assistants may allow the design of more intuitive interactions whilst maintaining a high level of control, helping lower the cost of entry to composition for novices and offer stimulating new creative tools for professional musicians.\n We introduce PIANOTO, a touch-ready, responsive web interface for creating expressive piano performances through AI-assisted inpainting, all via simple swipe operations. This open-source, model-agnostic prototype is designed with both novice and expert users in mind, for usage either as a standalone tool or in conjunction with existing DAWs, on desktop or mobile.",

With the increasing importance of social media and, consequently, content creation, music is taking a vital role in accompanying the created media, being able to capture the consumer's attention or set a mood. \n \n However, new challenges arise regarding obtaining music to accompany the created media. While royalty-free production music allows for its usage without significant issues, navigating extensive collections for a music piece suitable to the content being made can be tiresome.\n \n In this late-breaking demo, we present Beatoven.ai, an online tool for creating royalty-free music according to high-level parameters which do not require expert music creation knowledge. The user control enables the generated music piece to fit exactly what content creators have in mind and the content's requirements.",

    "abstract": "Melody Slot Machine HD is an application that allows one to generate melodies using music structures while playing a slot machine. The user can create new melody combinations by rearranging melody variations using the slot machine. When the user composes a melody with variations, the structure of the melody is analyzed using a theory of music known as the generative theory of tonal music. Even if the melody switches variations in the middle, the overall structure will not be disrupted. Our original Melody Slot Machine has been exhibited in academic conference as a demo system. Due to Covid-19, however, it has become difficult to exhibit in places where many people gather, so we developed an app version for the iPad, Melody Slot Machine HD, to give many people access to it through the Appstore. We conducted an experiment to evaluate Melody Slot Machine HD, and the results indicate that when five participants listened to new variations of melodies generated by random combinations using Melody Slot Machine HD, 85.6% of the melodies were judged as natural or almost natural.",

    "abstract": "Sheet music, which contains precise instructions for performers, remains a primary mechanism for communicating musical ideas. While digital scans of sheet music (represented as images) and recordings of performances (represented as audio) are both abundant sources of musical data, there remains a surprising paucity of aligned data, mappings between pixels in sheet music and the corresponding timestamps in associated performances. While several existing MIR datasets contain alignments between performances and structured scores (formats like MIDI and MusicXML), no current resources align performances with more commonplace raw-image sheet music, possibly due to obstacles like expressive timing and repeat signs that make alignment challenging and time-consuming even for trained musicians. To overcome these obstacles, we developed an interactive system, MeSA , which leverages off-the-shelf measure and beat detection software to aid musicians in quickly producing measure-level alignments (ones which map bounding boxes of measures in the sheet music to timestamps in the performance audio). We verified MeSA \u2019s functionality by using it to create a small proof-of-concept dataset, MeSA-13.",

It gives the audience a different impression by different dynamics of loudness.\n Due to the polyphonic characteristics of piano having many information such as melody line and accompaniment line, it is more meaningful to find loudness for each note than looking at accumulated loudness of a certain time frame. \n \n There have been a few researches having tackled to this topic by a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to find note level loudness. This research provides a novel method by Deep Neural Network (DNN) with score information by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to estimate the loudness based on MIDI velocity for each note performed by piano players. \n This is the first research which tried to estimate the MIDI velocity by a DNN model in end to end fashion between audio to MIDI velocity.",

We extend the baseline synthesizer by appending lightweight black-box postnets applying further processing to the baseline output in order to improve fidelity. An alternative differentiable approach relies on the extraction of the source excitation spectrum directly, and results in improved naturalness, albeit for a narrower class of style transfer applications.

    "abstract": "Explainability for the behavior of deep learning models has been a topic of increasing interest, as these black box networks have become ubiquitous across machine learning tasks in general and in Music Information Retrieval. Our past research into learned feature representations of Predominant Instrument Recognition (PIR) models using adversarial training showed that these models are quite fragile. As a result, we propose a PIR framework that is interpretable by nature, using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to iteratively include adversarial advancements in the PIR classifier. To do this we reframe PIR as a conditional-generative task using an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) and train a PIR classifier concurrently with an instrument synthesis model, which is then used to explore the feature space learned by the ACGAN. Preliminary results show that the ACGAN is capable of generating Mel-spectrogram outputs that closely resemble the input data. Based on these findings, we propose a novel modified ACGAN Classifier with a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) framework addition to address instability in the ACGAN training.",

Our model takes in tablature conditioning in a 6-channel MIDI-like format and outputs synthesized audio. We utilize DDSP-style synthesis, in which parameters are predicted which drive differentiable implementations of harmonic oscillator and filtered noise synthesizer modules. A monophonic decoder network is used to predict harmonic amplitudes and noise filters for each guitar-string voice from the tablature conditioning. Finally, the 6 channels of synthesized guitar string audio are summed and fed through a reverb module with trainable parameters. In this work, we investigate the use of a guitar-string embedding layer which encodes the guitar-string ID for each note in the conditioning. We compare 2 model variations, the basic model and the string embedding model. While this research is ongoing, our preliminary results indicate that the use of string embeddings results in improved synthesis. Moving forward, we aim to incorporate this differentiable guitar synthesis model into a an unsupervised system for automatic guitar transcription.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become more popular due to their great success in various tasks.\n However, their improvements made them more capable but less interpretable.\n To overcome this issue, some introspection techniques have been proposed.\n According to the fact that ANNs are inspired by human brains, we adapt techniques from cognitive neuroscience to easier interpret them.\n Our approach first computes characteristic network responses for groups of input examples, for example, relating to a specific error.\n We then use these to compare network responses between different groups.\n To this end, we compute representational similarity and we visualize the activations as topographic activation maps.\n In this work, we present a graphical user interface called CogXAI ANNalyzer to easily apply our techniques to trained ANNs and to interpret their results.\n Further, we demonstrate our tool using an audio ANN for speech recognition.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges in modeling of symbolic musical information is the correct representation and manipulation of pitch, in particular in the Western standard notation system. This late-breaking demo introduces a set of libraries for different programming languages that provide unified types and operations, as well as a common notation system for different pitch and interval types. In particular, these libraries provide an API for working with spelled pitches and intervals as used in the Western notation system. This reduces the complexity of using properly represented pitches and intervals in computational modelling, machine learning, and data analysis, and potentially improves compatibility (and thus reusability) of different models.",

    "abstract": "Before magnetic tape recording was common, acetate discs were the main audio storage medium for radio broadcasters. Acetate discs only had a capacity to record about ten minutes. Longer material was recorded on overlapping discs using (at least) two recorders. Unfortunately, the recorders used were not reliable in terms of recording speed, resulting in audio of variable speed. \n \n To make digitized audio originating from acetate discs fit for reuse, (1) overlapping parts need to be identified, (2) a precise alignment needs to be found and (3) a mixing point suggested. All three steps are challenging due to the audio speed variabilities.\n  \n This paper introduces the ideas behind DiscStitch: which aims to reassemble audio from overlapping parts, even if variable speed is present. The main contribution is a fast and precise audio alignment strategy based on spectral peaks. The method is evaluated on a synthetic data set.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning-based audio creation are fueling the rise of a new approach to musical sound design: neural synthesis. In this project, an implementation of neural waveform synthesis on a resource-limited embedded development platform is explored using a modified version of Google Magenta\u2019s Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) timbre transfer pipeline on an Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB embedded prototyping board. This work introduces a standalone hardware/software system for running DDSP timbre transfer models offline. It features a physical control interface for audio input and output, and a selection of five neural timbre models to choose from. The streamlined neural synthesis pipeline uses YIN in lieu of CREPE for input audio feature extraction, resulting in a processing latency reduction, but inferior output quality in noisy environments. Qualitative research data indicate that users find the device to be useful, intuitive, and fun to interact with; however, its audio rendering speed remains too slow for many practical use cases. As this project is designed to be readily replicable by end users, the source code, build instructions, and audio examples are all made freely available.",
