    "abstract": "Mind Improvisation II,' building on the concepts of 'Mind Improvisation' and 'Growing Seeds,' merges neural signal processing with embodied performance.Using a 15-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device (NIRSIT Lite), the performer's prefrontal cortex activity is streamed live to a custom Max/MSP environment. The performer's \u0394HbO signals are interpreted not as binary triggers but as expressive, continuous parameters\u2014modulating filters, synthesis engines, and real-time audio morphing tools. Simultaneously, a Yamaha Disklavier fulfills a dual role: As a readymade improviser, it acoustically replays pre-recorded performances\u2014the \u201cghost\u201d layer. As a live acoustic instrument, it is physically played by the performer in real time. These layers\u2014brain-driven synthesis and live/automated piano\u2014are recursively shaped by the performer's evolving neural states. Auditory output and visual feedback, in turn, influence the brain, forming a perceptual-cognitive feedback loop. The system embodies the concept of transformation as both process and event, echoing the principles of Process Art and Deleuzian deterritorialization. Brain signals are treated not as mere control data but as an expressive medium, enabling a decentered and emergent artistic language. This work challenges conventional authorship by positioning the brain as both subject and source of the performance. The audience witnesses an improvisation sculpted by moment-to-moment mental fluctuations, transforming not a metaphor, but an immediate, embodied experience",

    "abstract": "Aleatorica is a mosaic-like music map that visualizes and sonifies the interval content of a large dataset of music by aleatorically regenerating its melody, creating a sonic space for exploring the continuum of melodic features in contemporary music. Following the idea of a 'lecture-concert', this performance will touch on the computational and music theoretical methods used to create such an interface. In order to create the map, a large dataset of MIDI format songs was collected and processed into interval distributions based on note transition frequency. Afterwards, Earth Mover's Distance is computed between distributions using a music-theory informed cost matrix and subsequently used in the UMAP algorithm to generate a latent representation of the dataset. Afterwards, a tiled design is generated using Voronoi tessellation on the dimensionality reduced plot and colored based on quantifiable music theoretical features on the interval distributions. Finally, the interval distribution is used to derive a Markovian transition matrix, which can be used to aleatorically generate music. Additionally, Aleatorica will be available as a website, promoting audience interaction and personal discovery. The resulting performance is a compelling inspection of the landscape of modern melody, blurring the lines between music data visualization and data-driven sound art.",

The melody variations are generated on the basis of the AI-based melody-morphing method and can be partially switched to another variation without any significant change in the overall melody structure and with no musical breakdown.

    "abstract": "One, Two, Many is a three-way partnership between two human performers and an Artificial 'Intelligence'. One of the main challenges in human - AI co-creation is the question of motivation, goals, or aesthetic preferences. Cutting-edge AI systems are very good imitation systems increasingly able to reproduce human-like outputs. But computers are obviously incapable of aesthetic judgements or goals. In One, Two, Many the AI systems joins the flute players in realising the piece as a partner defined by an aesthetic preference - that of an impatient listener, one who seeks novelty. First the AI 'listens' to each flute and evaluates similarity and surprise in real-time. Stable input - signals that are predictability or similar to previous signals - increases the 'boredom' in the system. When this boredom gets over a defined threshold the computer changes it internal setting to achieve musical change and resets the boredom. The computer, therefore, interprets an audio signal and changes it's own musical behaviour based on this interpretation: a system that listens and responds according to some aesthetic criteria. While the realisation of this piece involves a partnership between the human performers and the AI, this is an unequal partnership. First, the AI is only able to transform the flute sounds not initiated sounds on its own. Second, the aesthetic preference in the system are obviously rather simple and lack the nuance, sophistication, or experience of a human musician. Since listening is at the heart of the multi-party interaction envisioned, the score is designed to allow the performers a degree of freedom. Freedom to respond to and try to influence the AI as well as ability to respond to each other. The parts are loosely coordinated - pages act as coordination units. But within each page players have some optional figures, alternatives and choice of repetition. The performers, therefore, are able to control, to a degree, the similarity/change in the music and thus interact with the aesthetic 'preferences' of the AI.",
