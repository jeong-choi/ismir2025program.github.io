<p>No</p>

<p>Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Q20 (Overall evaluation (to be completed before the discussion phase): Please first evaluate before the discussion phase. Keep in mind that minor flaws can be corrected, and should not be a reason to reject a paper. Please familiarize yourself with the reviewer guidelines at https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines.)</strong></p>
<p>Weak reject</p>
<p><strong>Q21 (Main review and comments for the authors (to be completed before the discussion phase). Please summarize strengths and weaknesses of the paper. It is essential that you justify the reason for the overall evaluation score in detail. Keep in mind that belittling or sarcastic comments are not appropriate.)</strong></p>
<p>Strengths:
- The paper aims at converting an offline piano transcription system to a real-time one with a low latency
- Low latency can be achieved by modifying to STFT window to Tukey, and by network modifications such as removing velocity conditioning and sharing some computations. 
- Extensive experimentation</p>
<p>Weaknesses:
- The takeaways from the paper seem limited.
- The performance improvement appears marginal at larger tolerances. E.g., in Table 4, causal-AMT is much worse than mobile-AMT at 30 ms and 50 ms tolerances. 
- I wonder, practically, how useful are the F1 scores reported for 10ms tolerance in Table 4, even for causal-AMT? The paper should include a discussion around the practical uses of the best settings suggested in the paper.</p>
<p>Title:
- the title says "Exploring network adaptations ..." but there are modifications outside the network, such as in STFT window. May be the title could be "Exploring adaptations ..." or "Exploring system adaptations ...".</p>
<p><strong>Q22 (Final recommendation (to be completed after the discussion phase) Please give a final recommendation after the discussion phase. In the final recommendation, please do not simply average the scores of the reviewers. Note that the number of recommendation options for reviewers is different from the number of options here. We encourage you to take a stand, and preferably avoid “weak accepts” or “weak rejects” if possible.)</strong></p>
<p>Accept</p>
<p><strong>Q23 (Meta-review and final comments for authors (to be completed after the discussion phase))</strong></p>
<p>All reviewers appreciate the work. The practical utility of the topic and the detailed analysis is admirable. There are some critical comments that the authors may take note of.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>The paper is well written and clear. The non simmetric windowing function used for limit the amount of "future" information and steering the analysis towards causality is a nice feature. However, a certain number of "future" information is still needed if you want a good accuracy. I honestly think that, especially for lower frequency, this limitation it will be hard to overcome, regardles the method used! Reducing the model size for reducing complexity is another good point, and doing it without sacrifice the performances is always a challenge. The evaluation covers different aspects, however It would be beneficial to see a comparision with other methods, like for example the cited [6,7,14,15] with the same test set.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>This paper is an important step in a direction that is often overlooked in academia, yet is important for practical applications of AMT where low latency is required.</p>
<p>Strengths:
* Numerous experiments and detailed ablations
* Insightful remarks on the baseline model that show deep understanding of the architecture
* Interesting exploration of under-explored topic that is important for practical applications</p>
<p>Weaknesses:
* Actual processing time is not measured or discussed. Is the resulting model actually fast enough to run in 10 ms on consumer hardware? (I doubt it.) Have authors tested this? Otherwise, the choice of 10 ms frames should be revisited, since it's not practical.
* Tables are hard to read, results could be presented in a clearer way, or some of the evaluations could be omitted to keep the more important ones
* Asymmetric window is chosen due to improved results without discussing its effect on the STFT (I can assume it leads to increased spectral leakage due to larger main lobe and side lobes)</p>
<p>Additional comments:</p>
<p>Line 36: “latter two” doesn’t seem to match order of references. Please specify which ones.
Line 107: I believe Kwon et al. also show an experiment with latency of 128 ms. 
Line 153: interesting insight about 10 s latency due to Squeeze and Excitation
Line 230: Using a weighted loss to deal with class imbalance is a well known technique, used for example in AMT in the ‘Basic Pitch’ paper by Rachel Bittner et al. It’d be nice to cite that or a more general reference.
Line 304: Is ‘assymetric Tukey window’ really a correct term here? The Tukey window is a cosine-tapered rectangular window, but here there is no rectangular element. I suppose ‘assymetric Hann window’ could be a better name.
Lines 361-365: A3-5 and A6-8 are not detailed. Either omit some results from the table, or explain what the experiments are.
Line 379: I’m not sure this logic makes sense to me. Why does robustness to lower tolerance threshold imply the model is more promising? Why do authors have a strict tolerance requirement? If the main requirement is for lower latency, the requirement for accurate time-localization can/should be relaxed.
Section 4.4: Which post-processing method is used for Mobile-AMT? Is it evaluated with the same heuristics as Causal-AMT, or with the original heuristics?
Section 4.4: There's no sufficient explanation for why Mobile-AMT performs poorly with strict timing tolerance. This is a surprising result which should be explained.
Section 5: First two paragraph repeat the latency discussion done in the introduction. Most of the given latency numbers are not relevant when discussing what is the desired/required latency for an AMT system.
Line 468: “...we reduce model size” - what is the difference in terms of FLOPs and/or number of parameters, compared to the baseline?</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>This paper has completed a detailed case study of an existing online piano transcription framework, Mobile-AMT, and proposed thorough updates to transform it into a fully causal version capable of real-time processing with a latency below 30ms.</p>
<p>The analysis and experiment design has shown a solid amount of work the author has put into this research. The author has analyzed the full pipeline of the Mobile-AMT, from the pre-processing window and model architecture to onset identification post-processing algorithms. A corresponding solution is proposed for each issue in the previous framework, followed up with experiment results for proper justification. Also, all the modifications deliver the overall principle of "causality only". Well structured.</p>
<p>According to Table 4, the proposed model's performance doesn't change much under different tolerances. A more detailed analysis of this phenomenon would help us understand the pros and cons of the proposed model architecture.</p>
<p>It is also worth trying to loosen the n_s to adapt for longer tolerance in Table 4 for a more well-rounded comparison. Although Table 2 has already shown the preliminary results of different window settings, a comparison of the fully trained models can serve as the final performance baseline to show how your model balances latency and accuracy, which will benefit follow-up work.</p>
