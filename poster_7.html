<p>Strong accept</p>
<p><strong>Q21 (Main review and comments for the authors (to be completed before the discussion phase). Please summarize strengths and weaknesses of the paper. It is essential that you justify the reason for the overall evaluation score in detail. Keep in mind that belittling or sarcastic comments are not appropriate.)</strong></p>
<p>The highlight of the paper is the logical explanation of why the proposed method works. Unlike other papers that present a method only by comparing it to other previous methods, this paper explains the core problem of estimating synthesizer parameters from acoustic signals and presents a solution for it. </p>
<p>The weakness could be the lack of a rough abstract at the beginning of the method section, which would enable readers to prepare for the mathematical formulation.</p>
<p><strong>Q22 (Final recommendation (to be completed after the discussion phase) Please give a final recommendation after the discussion phase. In the final recommendation, please do not simply average the scores of the reviewers. Note that the number of recommendation options for reviewers is different from the number of options here. We encourage you to take a stand, and preferably avoid “weak accepts” or “weak rejects” if possible.)</strong></p>
<p>Strong accept</p>
<p><strong>Q23 (Meta-review and final comments for authors (to be completed after the discussion phase))</strong></p>
<p>This paper Indicates an issue of symmetries in synthesizer parameter space and providing alternative solutions for the problem could widely contribute to other MIR tasks. Unlike other papers that present a method only by comparing it to other previous methods, this paper explains the core problem of estimating synthesizer parameters from acoustic signals and presents a solution for it. We reviewers would like to suggest strong accept for this paper. </p>
<p>As reviewers indicate weaknesses in readability (reviewer 1), typos and notation problems (reviewer 3), and the unclearness of the initialization process and Figure 2 (reviewer 4), I strongly suggest checking through the draft and modifying the points in the camera-ready version.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>This paper explores the problem of symmetries in synthesizer parameter sets within the task of in-domain sound matching.</p>
<p>The paper addresses a relevant problem and proposes several solutions. The results obtained with a real-world synthesizer show an improvement over other methods, although most of the improvement seems to come from the use of continuous normalizing flows.</p>
<p>The text is generally hard to read, and the authors should make an effort to make it more accessible. The problem of synthesizer inversion is quite niche, and it should be defined much earlier. The abstract should allow non-experts to understand what the paper is about more generally. The approach in 3.1 could be explained more clearly, and generally more diagrams (e.g. from the supplementary materials) would help, whereas even more of the mathematical detail could also be moved to the supplementary material.</p>
<p>The need of automatic handling of permutations could also be justified better. First, the problem assumes uniform sampling of parameters, whereas many works have been based on real-world parameter databases. It is unclear how the symmetries affect the models in this case, and what is the best solution for existing synthesizers. In this sense, the difference in results observed at the end of 4.2.3 should be further clarified or corrected. Second, the authors disregard manual approaches, and claim that automation would scale better, but this is not as obvious as it may seem. As an example, in the first experiment the asymmetric variants (which are a sort of manual mapping of the parameters) perform better, which is not discussed. It is also not clear enough in this experiment that the proposed methods are much better than existing approaches, so it seems at least some should also be used in the second experiment. Generally there seem to be many differences between the two experiments (e.g. missing CNF(Equivariant), AST conditioning), which should be justified. Some discussion of computational cost would help understanding the benefits/cost of this approach against a manual mapping or non-random training data.
Finally, given the performance of CNF (MLP), the authors should discuss this model more in depth in relation to previous work using normalizing flows, and acknowledge the limitations of the proposed approach.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>The paper presents a technique to estimate the parameters of a synthesizer from an audio generated with such instrument by taking into account the symmetries of the problem and equivariant flow matching. While I highly enjoyed the topic and the innovative solution, my main concerns are relative to the accessibility of the paper. The topic is not simple and a lot of concepts are taken into account. I wonder if the paper is not more well suited to a longer and more in-depth journal paper than to a conference. Nonetheless it is an interesting work.</p>

<p>shouldn’t vector “x” be in bold? (col right row 250) 
also, are the elements concatenated all together in a single column vector? Do they all belong to the range -1,1 </p>
<p>4.1 Results
“CNF (PA R A M 2 T O K) performs on par with the best models across conditions,” —&gt; this is not true, in some situations it actually performs worse e.g. k=32 for LAC Symmetric and MSE symmetric in all cases</p>
<p>4.2.2
For more detail on this point, see the supplementary material. —&gt; should be a journal paper</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>strengths: the problem is relevant in many inverse problems and essential to consider if performing sound matching task on industry-scale synthesizers. the approach is novel. The insights are significant. the metrics adopted are state-of-the-art approaches refined upon previous metrics. 
weaknesses: in section 3.2, it is unclear how z z’ and A are initialized such that param2tok is invariant to permutation of the parameter vector. its unclear to me how figure 2 illustrated the fact that “transformer’s equivariance can be used if a permutation symmetry is present in the data but will not be enforced if not”.</p>
