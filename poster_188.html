<meta name="citation_abstract" content="A large-scale dataset is essential for training a well-generalized deep learning model. Most such datasets are collected via scraping from various internet sources, inevitably introducing duplicated data. In the symbolic music domain, these duplicates often come from multiple user arrangements and metadata changes after simple editing.

This study investigates the dataset duplication issues regarding Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD), one of the largest publicly available sources in the symbolic music domain. To find and evaluate the best retrieval method for duplicated data, we employed the Clean MIDI subset of the LMD as a benchmark test set, in which different versions of the same songs are grouped together. We first evaluated rule-based approaches and previous symbolic music retrieval models for de-duplication and also investigated with a contrastive learning-based BERT model with various augmentations to find duplicate files. As a result, we propose three different versions of filtered list of LMD, which filters out at least 38,134 samples in most conservative settings among 178,561 files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;[Direct link to video]()&lt;/b&gt;" />

It is essential that you justify the reason for the overall evaluation score in detail. Keep in mind that belittling or sarcastic comments are not appropriate.)</strong></p>
<p>Overall, this paper presents a highly useful evaluation of different methodologies for removing duplicates from large symbolic datasets. It could be usefully applied to a wide range of MIR-related domains, beyond even those highlighted by the authors. The Lakh MIDI Dataset (and the Clean version of it) are good choices for carrying out the research, and the methodology and evaluation are generally good (although the language used should perhaps be moderated, as noted below). A nice variety of methods are evaluated, both together and in combination, and expert sampling of the final results when applied to the full LMD was an essential step that was properly followed.</p>
<p>One possible area of improvement is a more nuanced and musically relevant discussion of what makes two symbolic music files “the same” or “similar” to the extent that they can be considered duplicates for the purposes discussed here. Section 3 does present a useful distinction between “hard” and “soft” duplication, but more detail and justification is needed, as this issue is foundational to the entire task, and these are very short sub-sections. Ultimately, thresholds based on precision on Clean LMD were used, which to me is a very dataset and application-specific approach that sidesteps fundamentally important underlying musical questions. Also, certain assertions perhaps need more justification (e.g., why are ornamentations or chord tones under the purview of hard duplication, but not transpositions to different keys?). There are many related underlying issues that should ideally be discussed, and which are methodologically relevant; for example, one common issue that comes up in duplication detection of MIDI is the difference between the “same” music when encoded by a score editor vs. a different score editor vs. a MIDI instrument played by a human vs. a music generator vs. etc.</p>
<p>Certain assertions should perhaps be reconsidered. For example, the abstract states that “dataset duplication has yet to be discussed seriously in the MIR community,” a statement that I would disagree strongly with, and the paper itself later cites an ISMIR paper that does in fact seriously discuss it ([30]), and there are certainly other examples as well in the MIR literature.</p>
<p>Another issue that could be discussed a little more is how well models or algorithms trained or tuned on LMD Clean can generalize to LMD in general, or more importantly, to entirely different datasets. LMD clean isn’t that big, it is not stylistically representative and it is not in fact itself so clean (as noted by the authors in lines 403 to 408).</p>
<p>It would also be useful to know what the processing times are of the various approaches (especially the combined approaches), in order to have a sense of how scalable they are.</p>
<p>The results in Table 3 (and the thresholds adopted intentionally by the authors) result in decent precision but very low recall, meaning that many duplicates will be missed. The authors say that they “prioritize high precision to minimize unintended data loss during the final de-duplication process,” which is a fair point, but on the other hand the entire motivational premise of this paper is that duplicates can pose a huge problem, which seems at odds with this sentiment. Perhaps this seeming contradiction could be resolved in the text?</p>
<p>Also, even the high precision may not in reality be that high in practice, as shown by the listening results described in Section 7. If only 72.9% of the sampled detected LMD duplicates are in fact true hard or soft duplicates, that means that the precision found on clean LMD did not in fact generalize. Furthermore, if many false negatives occurred even on clean LMD, this suggest the potential that perhaps an even greater fraction of duplicates were missed on LMD, and potentially even more would be if the approach were applied to an entirely different dataset.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that this paper doesn’t offer a useful contribution; it is, as being able to remove even a subset of duplicates, hopefully at a small loss of non-duplicates, is certainly a useful contribution. But statements like “we found that the 38 134 files in the LMD-full (21.4%) are considered as duplication with very high confidence” are perhaps not appropriate; if the listening sampling found that only 72.9% of detected duplicates were actually duplicates, I’m not sure that I would express “very high confidence” in those 38 134 files actually being duplicates. It is OK if results are not perfect, and it is better to be direct about their limitations.</p>
<p>The paper is generally well-written, but there are a number of grammatical errors that could be corrected by additional editing.</p>
<p>Certain aspects should be expanded on in order to improve clarity. In particular, more details are needed on LMD Clean, particularly given the fundamental role it plays in this research. More information is also needed on Beat Position Entropy and Chroma-DTW than what is provided in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.3. For the latter in particular, are the authors saying that only basic pitch histograms (which presumably lost all sequence information) were used for all but 250 of the files, rather than actual Chroma-DTW?</p>
<p>Several of the references in the bibliography are missing dates.</p>
<p>The paper states that the code, metadata, training data, and evaluation results will all be distributed after publication. However, no anonymized supplementary material was submitted to make it possible to verify this.</p>
<p><strong>Q22 (Final recommendation (to be completed after the discussion phase) Please give a final recommendation after the discussion phase. In the final recommendation, please do not simply average the scores of the reviewers. Note that the number of recommendation options for reviewers is different from the number of options here.

<p>Strong accept</p>
<p><strong>Q23 (Meta-review and final comments for authors (to be completed after the discussion phase))</strong></p>
<p>All four reviewers unanimously agreed that this paper offers insights that will be of value to the MIR community, and we are delighted to recommend it for acceptance at ISMIR 2025.</p>
<p>Dataset duplication is an important but understudied issue in MIR, and we believe that this paper will both bring important greater awareness of the issue and provide a directly usable methodology for at least reducing the number of duplicates in symbolic datasets. Useful quantitative insight is also offered with respect to this issue on the Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD), something that is in itself a useful contribution, given the wide use of the LMD.</p>
<p>There are, however, certain issues with respect to both methodology and clarity that have been highlighted in the individual reviews, particularly with respect to how some of the empirical results are interpreted in the text. If this paper is accepted at ISMIR, we strongly encourage the author(s) to take these suggestions into account when preparing their camera-ready version of the paper.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>This paper addresses a crucial and often overlooked issue in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community: dataset duplication, specifically within the widely used Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD). The authors provide a thorough investigation into the scale of this problem and evaluate various approaches for de-duplication, culminating in the proposal of a combined method.</p>
<p>Strengths:
The paper tackles a highly relevant problem that directly impacts the reliability of research using LMD for tasks like music generation. Highlighting this issue is a significant contribution to the field.
The authors present and evaluate a performance pipeline for identifying duplicates, suggesting a methodology that could be applied to other datasets or related problems. This systematic approach has potential for future research.
The authors quantify the extent of duplication in LMD, providing concrete numbers that underscore the importance of the problem.
A small but reliable listening test is performed to help validate the detection process qualitatively.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:
A primary limitation, as acknowledged by the authors, is the difficulty in effectively detecting "soft duplicates" – different arrangements of the same song.
Applying this methodology to new data would likely require significant tuning, as the algorithmic results may not be as directly transferable or durable as the specific de-duplicated list provided for LMD. The main, highly practical outcome of this work for the community is the released filtered list for LMD.</p>
<p>Overall:
This is a timely paper for the ISMIR community. The proposed methods and the released filtered lists offer practical tools for researchers. While the relatively low recall across all methods prevents it from being a definitive, perfectly complete solution to the duplication problem in LMD, I believe that identifying the scope and challenge of this significant duplication problem is a large and valuable contribution on its own.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper explores several different approaches to the problem of data deduplication in large MIDI datasets, including rule-based approaches, the use of deep learning models released in previous papers, and the use of a new model (CAugBERT) designed and trained by the authors. The paper finds that using CLaMP + CAugBERT to perform deduplication outperforms using either individually.</p>
<p>The paper focuses on the Lakh MIDI dataset, a widely used dataset in the field of symbolic music processing. While other large datasets (including but not limited to MetaMIDI, GigaMIDI, SymphonyNet, and PDMX) are now available, the approach taken in the paper should generalize to those datasets. </p>
<p>This is timely work that addresses a core issue in the symbolic music processing community.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I recommend strong acceptance of this paper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses/suggestions for improvement:</p>
<p>Line 124: "the rule-based approach" -&gt; "rule-based approaches" (the paper evaluates more than one rule-based approach)</p>
<p>Line 230: "and the hash values of all MIDI files" I'm not sure what this means. Please make this clear.</p>
<p>Line 233: "that has exactly" -&gt; "that have exactly"</p>
<p>Line 235: "applied simple method" -&gt; "applied a simple method"</p>
<p>Line 236: Does the MIDI encoding scheme of [36] do something unusual with note position? (Why are you using this encoding scheme in particular?)</p>
<p>Lines 232-239: Are you using note position within measure (that would be my guess) or note position within the whole piece?</p>
<p>Line 264: "MIDI as MTF" -&gt; "MIDI to MTF"</p>
<p>Line 280: What is the point of the 98:1:1 split of LMD-filtered? Please say exactly what the 1 and 1 portions of the split used for. (I am a little confused because I understand that LMD-clean, not LMD-filtered, is used for evaluation)</p>
<p>Line 296: "The model implementation" -&gt; "The implementation of CAugBERT" </p>
<p>Line 338: "following the provided code" -&gt; "following the code provided in [citations]". Also, did you have to train this projection layer, or were the weights for this projection layer provided in the CLaMP releases?</p>
<p>Line 399: "We note" -&gt; "We also note"</p>
<p>Line 417: "with the best-performing CAugBERT" -&gt; "with CAugBERT" </p>
<p>Table 5 caption: When you refer to the threshold &gt;= 0.99, do you mean the threshold that results in precision on LMD-clean of 0.99, or do you mean the threshold on the model's output probability itself?</p>
<p>Table 5 caption: I think "# Clusters refers to the number of clusters and # Duplicates refers to the number of samples to be filtered" can be removed if you need space elsewhere for revisions.</p>
<p>Line 439: In the language of graph theory, the "clusters of duplication" are the connected components of the graph.</p>
<p>Line 459: "underrepresented while training on LMD-clean" LMD-clean was not "trained on," right? (I understand it was used for thresholding.)</p>
<p>Lines 448-458 and Figure 1: 
Did the author compare every file in each cluster to every other file in the cluster, or did they only compare files connected by an edge? (I imagine that not every cluster you found is a complete graph.) </p>
<p>The percentages here and the bars in Figure 1 are hard to understand as written, because without additional definition, labels like "hard duplicate" and "soft duplicate" apply to <em>pairs</em> of files, not individual files. To illustrate, there may be a file A, which is a soft duplicate of file B, which is a soft duplicate of file C, but A and C are not soft duplicates of one another. </p>
<p>How is Figure 1 meant to be interpreted? My guess is that the bar heights represent counts of files (not counts of file pairs), a file falls into the "hard duplicate" category if it is a hard duplicate of some other file in its cluster, a file falls into the "soft duplicate" category if it is not a hard duplicate of any file in its cluster and is a soft duplicate of at least one other file in its cluster, a file is in the "similar" category if it is not a hard duplicate of any file in its cluster, it is not a soft duplicate of any file in its cluster, and it is similar to at least one other file in its cluster, and a file is "irrelevant" if it is none of the above. I'm confused why the unhatched bars don't add up to 506, and I am also confused on exactly what the prediction type breakdown in Figure 1 means. For instance, the grey area of the "Irrelevant" bar means what, exactly? Issues like this should be clarified.</p>
