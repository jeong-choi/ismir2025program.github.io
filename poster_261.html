<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our insights on the underlying problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;[Direct link to video]()&lt;/b&gt;" />

<p>Strongly Disagree (Well-explored topic, task, or application)</p>
<p><strong>Q14 (Reusable insights: The paper provides reusable insights (i.e. the capacity to gain an accurate and deep understanding). Such insights may go beyond the scope of the paper, domain or application, in order to build up consistent knowledge across the MIR community.)</strong></p>
<p>Agree</p>
<p><strong>Q15 (Please explain your assessment of reusable insights in the paper.)</strong></p>
<p>The paper implements some ways to incorporate invariance and equivariance principles for data augmentation. These may be useful for other applications in music and audio processing.</p>
<p><strong>Q16 ( Write ONE line (in your own words) with the main take-home message from the paper.)</strong></p>
<p>Data augmentation methods that help deep models; the paper proposes a self-supervision method that needs more work.</p>
<p><strong>Q17 (This paper is of award-winning quality.)</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>Q19 (Potential to generate discourse: The paper will generate discourse at the ISMIR conference or have a large influence/impact on the future of the ISMIR community.)</strong></p>
<p>Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Q20 (Overall evaluation (to be completed before the discussion phase): Please first evaluate before the discussion phase. Keep in mind that minor flaws can be corrected, and should not be a reason to reject a paper. Please familiarize yourself with the reviewer guidelines at https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines.)</strong></p>
<p>Weak reject</p>
<p><strong>Q21 (Main review and comments for the authors (to be completed before the discussion phase). Please summarize strengths and weaknesses of the paper. It is essential that you justify the reason for the overall evaluation score in detail. Keep in mind that belittling or sarcastic comments are not appropriate.)</strong></p>
<p>Contributions:
- The paper presents learning methods for multi-pitch estimation.
- The paper uses transformations such as pitch shift and time stretching for augmenting the supervised data.</p>
<p>Limitations:
The loss function $\mathcal L_eg$ in eq (4) leads to degradation of performance. I would expect a deeper analysis of this loss function. E.g., plot the target $\tilde X$ alongside the true $\tilde Y$ to see if it really captures what we want the model to learn. To me, it seems that $\tilde X$ must be smeared out leading to a trivial solution, like a uniform distribution. </p>
<p>This is an important contribution of the paper, and hence, must be studied properly. Without this, the contributions of the paper seem to little to accept the paper. I would recommend to submit the work after this analysis and the subsequent improvements.</p>
<p>Other comments:
- Line 150: what is $u[k]$? How is applied to the input spectrograms? Please write it in the paper.
- In eqs. (3) and (3), $\hat Y$, the estimated output, should be replaced with $\tilde Y$, the target output. $\mathcal F(t(X))$ already means the estimated output.
- There are minor typos, such as "other other" in line 342.</p>
<p><strong>Q22 (Final recommendation (to be completed after the discussion phase) Please give a final recommendation after the discussion phase. In the final recommendation, please do not simply average the scores of the reviewers. Note that the number of recommendation options for reviewers is different from the number of options here. We encourage you to take a stand, and preferably avoid “weak accepts” or “weak rejects” if possible.)</strong></p>
<p>Accept</p>
<p><strong>Q23 (Meta-review and final comments for authors (to be completed after the discussion phase))</strong></p>
<p>All reviewers appreciate the paper and the efforts that went into it. There are some critical comments and some suggestions for further investigations that the authors may look into.</p>

<li><strong>Overall Evaluation</strong>: Weak accept</li>
</ul>
<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>The paper presents a method that uses self-supervised learning objectives within a supervised and semi-supervised approach to music transcription. It shows increase in performance when used in a supervised setting, and a surprising loss of generalization when used in a semi-supervised setting. Evaluation is thorough and although no "solution" to the problem is given, the obtained insights are useful.</p>
<p>I suggest to accept the paper, it is well written, of course more experiments and possible solutions would be welcome.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>In this paper, the authors present a series of experiments that combine supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms for training a multi-pitch estimation model. A key finding is that the model's performance deteriorates when additional unlabeled data from other datasets—used to enable self-supervised learning—is introduced. The authors report the effects of this behavior in detail.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is very well written, with each section building logically on the previous one. It also provides a useful summary of best practices in data preparation and loss function design, making it a self-contained and informative read for those seeking insight into current state-of-the-art approaches.</p>
<p>A particularly strong aspect of the paper is its systematic and well-documented experimental setup. Table 1 presents a range of strong baselines, followed by results from the proposed model using various combinations of supervised and self-supervised loss functions on datasets that contain appropriate labels.</p>
<p>However, when additional unlabeled data is introduced for self-supervised training, model performance declines. The discussion in Section 4 is especially insightful, as it attempts to diagnose the reasons behind this drop. The authors suggest that when datasets closely related to the supervised data are added for self-supervision, the model performance is negatively impacted—an effect supported by the experimental results.</p>
<p>One point that remains unclear is whether the authors believe self-supervision still holds promise for this task. Could alternative datasets better complement the supervised data and address its limitations? I also wondered about the behavior of the loss functions when combining labeled and unlabeled samples. Are supervised losses deactivated for unlabeled samples? Furthermore, do the supervised and self-supervised losses operate on the same numerical scale, or does one dominate the other? It would be helpful if the authors could report the typical ranges of these losses—e.g., mean supervised loss vs. mean self-supervised loss for labeled and unlabeled data—though this might be more appropriate for future work.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend accepting this paper. It is a valuable contribution and is likely to spark productive discussions at ISMIR 2025.</p>

<h4>Main Reviews</h4>
<p>This paper builds upon the self-supervised objectives proposed in the preprint [1] and performs a series of experiments</p>
<p>It compares how the self-supervised objectives interact with the usual supervision. It provides interesting insights regarding the behavior. One could imagine that the self-supervised objectives could help improve the models in data for which no label is present, addressing the difficulty of annotating large amount of data in MPE. However, it is observed that worse results are achieved.</p>
<p>The selection of dataset seems sufficient, although Maestro and Slakh dataset are not included. Surprising given how much data is available in those. But again, the data selection seems to contain enough variety of domains.</p>
<p>The insights provided through the different experiments look very interesting as well, demonstrating that there is still a requirement for work in this domain.</p>
<p>I think that something is missing however during evaluation.
As acknowledge by the authors, pitch is something perceptual. While labels employed for training consists usually of 1s and 0s, the truth is that the self-supervised objectives do not enforce this extreme choices. 
Moreover, if one thinks of the signal evolution over time, one could expect the pitches of certain instruments to decay over time, contrasting with the rigid 1s and 0s found in labels.
Given that a threshold is applied to the model's output, it is expected that if the model is actually starting to predict such smooth changes over time.
I would suggest to provide another extra evaluation:
- For those frames with active pitch: are the active pitches from the labels within the top K active pitches of the model's prediction? In this way another type of evaluation that does not rely on choosing an appropriate threshold could be employed.</p>
<p>Other comments:
- Line 69: What kind of refinement? They seem to me exactly like in [1]
- There is no formal definition of degeneration
- "teaches the model to degenerate on a specific distribution" sounds like a very weird phrase to me.</p>
