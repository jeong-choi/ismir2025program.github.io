This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels, and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions, alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos. Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;[Direct link to video]()&lt;/b&gt;" />

<p>This is the meta-reviewer's independent review for paper 87: PianoVAM: A Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset</p>
<p>This paper introduces the PianoVAM dataset, which is a multimodal dataset of piano performances. The paper describes how data were acquired and preprocessed, attributes of the dataset, as well as the fingering annotation algorithm and benchmark results between PianoVAM and MAESTRO and between audio-only and audio-video transcription. </p>
<p>I commend the authors for this comprehensive and well-written paper. The dataset serves as a useful contribution to the MIR field; the paper was thorough and information-dense, while also being easy to follow. The Introduction effectively the reader through the topics of multimodal MIR and piano transcriptions to arrive at the present work; and the tables and figures do an excellent job of summarizing a lot of information in understandable ways. I also thank the authors for the ethics statement in the paper, and for providing the anonymized repo and example video for review. I have two points of main feedback and other minor suggestions for the authors. </p>
<p>Main feedback
- The positioning of PianoVAM-Finger within the PianoVAM dataset in the paper was a little confusing. Based on visiting the repo, it seems the fingering information is indeed part of the larger dataset, but PianoVAM-Finger is first mentioned in Section 2.3 and Table 2, and its inclusion or separation wasn't totally clear to me. The authors could clarify this, for example, by mentioning PianoVAM-Finger by name earlier (e.g., in the Introduction) and state outright that it's part of PianoVAM.
- Please state the license of the dataset in the paper (at the start of Section 3 for example). </p>
<p>Other minor suggestions for the authors
- Section 2.1: There are additional audio-visual datasets not covered here; the authors could point out that those covered are just examples and not all available datasets of this kind. 
- The audio loudness normalization procedure in Section 3.2.2 makes sense. But can the non-normalized versions also be released as part of the dataset? Some users might wish to work with the original recordings or implement their own normalization procedure. If only the normalized audio is released, it is not clear how a user could get back to the original versions.
- Section 4 paragraph 1: Can the authors elaborate a bit on how the range of works/composers and performer skill levels compares to other published datasets? 
- Section 4 paragraph 2: The difference in sustain pedal usage between MAESTRO and PianoVAM is notable, especially when pitch and velocity distributions were well matched across the datasets. Can the authors speculate as to why PianoVAM has such higher use of the sustain petal? (E.g., performer skill, emphasis on informal practice, pieces performed, hardware?)
- Section 5: Can more information on the usage of the GUI-based fingering annotation tool be provided? Was it used only for the annotations reported in Section 5.2.1? Can more information be provided on the number of annotators, their qualifications, and the extent and nature of the annotations?
- Minor typos/wording issues: Line 228 "This sections"; line 252 sentence beginning "Floating hand", line 450 "which makes player to prepare".</p>
<p><strong>Q22 (Final recommendation (to be completed after the discussion phase) Please give a final recommendation after the discussion phase. In the final recommendation, please do not simply average the scores of the reviewers. Note that the number of recommendation options for reviewers is different from the number of options here.

<p><strong>Q23 (Meta-review and final comments for authors (to be completed after the discussion phase))</strong></p>
<p>This is the meta-review for paper 87: PianoVAM: A Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset. The paper received independent reviews from the meta-reviewer as well as 4 additional reviewers, all of whom were broadly positive in their assessments of the paper. </p>
<p>The reviews highlight many positive aspects of the paper including the clarity of writing, the paper being well-structured and densely informative, the value of the main contribution (the multimodal dataset), and clear relevance to MIR. The reviewers have also provided suggestions for improving the paper. Examples include missing details, a need for more explanation on the limited improvement in onset detection from adding visual information, potential shortcomings of focusing on practice sessions, opportunities for more reflection, and missing license. The authors are encouraged to read all of the reviews and incorporate the reviewer feedback.</p>
