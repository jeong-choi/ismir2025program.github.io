        <div class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 mb-4 text-left card-subtitle">
          <p>Recent years have witnessed growing interest in bridging traditional sound synthesis methods with emerging machine learning technologies. This tutorial is motivated by the convergence of two previously distinct trajectories in audio research: physics-based sound synthesis and data-driven neural approaches. This session highlights how differentiable physical modeling opens new avenues for musical sound synthesis by combining the interpretability and realism of physical simulation with the learning capacity of modern neural networks. The tutorial is structured into five segments: an overview of digital synthesis history and physical modeling, a detailed introduction to finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods across various instrument classes, a broad survey of neural architectures relevant to physical modeling, an in-depth look at differentiable modeling for parameter estimation using automatic differentiation, and a concluding session to synthesize key takeaways. Attendees will engage with theoretical material, practical demonstrations, and programming exercises, gaining hands-on experience in combining physics-based simulation with neural networks. This tutorial is designed for researchers and engineers interested in advanced sound synthesis, particularly those working in musical acoustics, AI-based audio modeling, or digital instrument design. It will benefit individuals seeking to build physically plausible audio models or hybrid machine learning systems for realistic sound generation. All ISMIR members are warmly encouraged to attend—whether newcomers or seasoned researchers. The tutorial is designed to be approachable rather than overly technical, while still offering a deep understanding of how differentiable simulation can enhance synthesis fidelity, support neural network training, and advance hybrid sound modeling.</p>

        <div class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 mb-4 text-left card-subtitle">
          <p>Differentiable digital signal processing is a technique in which signal processing algorithms are implemented as differentiable programs used in combination with deep neural networks. The advantages of this methodology include a reduction in model complexity, lower data requirements, and an inherently interpretible intermediate representation. In recent years, differentiable audio synthesizers have been applied to a variety of tasks, including voice and instrument modelling, synthesizer control, pitch estimation, source separation, and parameter estimation. Yet despite the growing popularity of such methods, the implementation of differentiable audio synthesizers remains poorly documented, and the simple formulation of many synthesizers belies their complex optimization behaviour. To address this gap, this tutorial offers an introduction to the fundamentals of differentiable synthesizer programming.</p>

          <p>With the rise of the attention mechanism and the success of auto-regressive generative modelling and large language models, the Transformer architecture has arguably been the most promising technology for symbolic music generation. While audio-based methods have shown promise, symbolic music generation offers distinct advantages in terms of control, long-term coherence and computational efficiency. This tutorial explores the potential of the Transformer architecture in symbolic music generation and aims to provide (1) a thorough understanding of the vanilla Transformer architecture (emphasising the reasoning behind its design choices) and the utilisation of large language models for symbolic music generation. Additionally, it offers (2) a comprehensive overview of the field, including a taxonomy and a curated list of valuable datasets. The tutorial delves into (3) an in-depth analysis of Transformer variants and large language models specifically tailored for symbolic music generation. Also, it examines (4) examples and advanced considerations such as style, musical conditioning, and real-time performance. Furthermore, the tutorial offers (5) two hands-on exercises using Google Colab Notebooks, enabling participants to apply the concepts covered. Overall, this tutorial equips participants with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to explore the power of the Transformer architecture in symbolic music generation.</p>

          <p>A core strategy in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is to use mid-level representations to connect and analyze music-related information across different domains. For example, these representations help link audio recordings to symbolic data such as pitches, chords, and lyrics. While traditional MIR approaches relied on expert knowledge to design these representations, recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to learn them directly from annotated data. This shift has led to major progress in tasks such as music transcription, chord recognition, pitch tracking, version identification, and lyrics alignment. A key challenge in training deep learning models for these tasks is the limited availability of strongly aligned datasets, which provide detailed frame-level annotations but are costly and time-consuming to produce. In contrast, weakly aligned data offers only coarse segment-level correspondences, making it easier to collect but harder to use with standard training methods. This tutorial addresses the problem by introducing differentiable alignment techniques, which enable models to learn from weakly aligned data using alignment-aware and fully differentiable loss functions. We begin with an intuitive overview of classical methods such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), followed by differentiable alternatives like Soft-DTW and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. The tutorial also introduces key concepts such as convex optimization and gradient computation, which are essential for integrating these methods into end-to-end learning systems. Applications in MIR are illustrated through case studies including multi-pitch estimation, transcription, score-audio alignment, and cross-version retrieval. This tutorial is intended for a broad audience and emphasizes both conceptual clarity and practical relevance. It equips participants with a solid understanding of how differentiable alignment techniques enable the training of deep models using weakly or partially aligned data. These methods are becoming increasingly important in MIR and other domains involving time-based multimedia data.</p>

          <p>This tutorial addresses the growing need to understand the decision-making processes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems with Deep Learning (DL) in the sound and music domain. As DL models continue to achieve state-of-the-art performance in music recognition, generation, and analysis, their lack of transparency poses a significant challenge for evaluating trained models and gaining insights from them. In response, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have emerged as a crucial tool for interpreting and understanding the behavior of complex DL models. However, the application of XAI in music is still a relatively underexplored area. This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive introduction to XAI methodologies and their application in the music domain. Through a combination of theoretical foundations and practical exercises, participants will gain a deeper understanding of XAI techniques and their potential to enhance the interpretability and transparency of DL models in music. The tutorial will cover the current state of XAI in music, discuss challenges and opportunities, and provide hands-on experience with applying XAI techniques to real-world music use cases. This tutorial is suitable for researchers and practitioners looking to expand their skills in XAI and its applications in music. A basic understanding of DL concepts is recommended, but no prior experience with XAI is required. For the practical exercises, prior knowledge of Python and PyTorch is beneficial.</p>

          <p>This tutorial provides an overview of emerging opportunities to develop and employ methods from Music Information Research for music, health, medicine and wellbeing. Music-based interventions are gaining recognition as a fertile domain for research, alongside rapidly growing developments in music technology to support music's affordances for health and well-being. We provide an overview and introduction for the MIR community to the potential contributions of computational methods to this field. The tutorial introduces examples of existing research and shows avenues for future directions, employing MIR's rich tradition of computational analysis of musical structures in different health settings. The three parts of the tutorial provide an overview on the topics of: <br><br> (1) MIR for Music Therapy (e.g. technologies for analyzing musical structures from clinical improvisations; for generating music targeting specific therapeutic functions; for supporting music-based training in between therapy sessions at home) (2) MIR in Music Heart Theranostics (use of music in digital therapeutics and precision diagnostics for cardiovascular health and disease; data and software tools for music and cardiovascular signals); (3) Neurology and Music Information in Epilepsy Research (e.g. studying music &amp; neurology in clinical settings; joint analysis of iEEG and music features; biomarkers of music processing in iEEG). <br><br> We reflect on the potential of MIR to support research into the effectiveness of music in the health context, employing computational analysis of musical, physiological, and behavioural data in researching underlying mechanisms of music interventions. The tutorial offers connections between established MIR topics (such as audio signal processing, symbolic music processing, pattern detection), and their applications in healthcare through interdisciplinary collaborations between MIR, music cognition, neuroscience, musicology, medicine, music therapy, and related fields. We keep the technical details at an introductory level and expect the tutorial to be suitable for established and new MIR researchers.</p>
